# í³š Contributing to the TypeScript Course

Welcome! We're thrilled you want to contribute to this comprehensive TypeScript course. This guide helps you contribute safely and effectively.

## í¾¯ Our Mission

We're building a **professional-grade TypeScript course** where students master both:
- **Core TypeScript** concepts (Types, Generics, Advanced Patterns)
- **Real-World Applications** (AI Engineering, Frontend Development)

The course follows a structured **Chapter â†’ Part** model with deep, research-backed content.

## í»Ÿ Workspace Structure for Contributors

### Contributing to Course Concepts

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b docs/chapter-3-part-1-generics-enhancement-alice

# Edit the concepts.md file
nano Chapter_3_Intermediate/Part_1_Generics_Basics/concepts.md

# Edit the exercises.md file
nano Chapter_3_Intermediate/Part_1_Generics_Basics/exercises.md

# Test your markdown renders correctly (optional)
# Review the file in VS Code with markdown preview

# Stage and commit

# Push and create PR
git push origin docs/chapter-3-part-1-generics-enhancement-alice
```

### Contributing to Learners Folder

**IMPORTANT**: The Learners folder is for INTERACTIVE PRACTICE, not for course content solutions.

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b learners/chapter-1-part-1-exercises-alice

# Create your exercise files in the TypeScript project
mkdir -p Learners/src/chapter1-fundamentals/part-1-why-typescript
cat > Learners/src/chapter1-fundamentals/part-1-why-typescript/exercise-1-basic-types.ts << EOF
/**
 * Exercise 1: Understanding Basic Types
 * 
 * In this exercise, you'll practice declaring variables with explicit types.
 * Complete each TODO section.
 */

// TODO 1: Create a string variable holding your name
// const myName: ... = "your name";

// TODO 2: Create a number variable for your age
// const myAge: ... = 25;

// TODO 3: Create a boolean for "I like TypeScript"
// const likeTypeScript: ... = true;

export {};  // Export empty for now
EOF

# Commit your contribution
git add Learners/src/chapter1-fundamentals/
git commit -m "[Learners] Chapter 1 Part 1 Exercises - @alice-dev"

# Push
git push origin learners/chapter-1-part-1-exercises-alice
```

**Guidelines for Learners Folder**:
- Create starter code with TODO comments
- Provide clear instructions in comments
- Include multiple difficulty levels
- Test that code compiles
- Don't add complete solutions (let learners solve)

## í³ Content Standards

All content should follow these standards:

### 1. Markdown Formatting
```markdown
# Main Title (H1)

**Bold for emphasis**
`inline code`

\`\`\`typescript
// Code blocks with syntax highlighting
\`\`\`
```

### 2. Code Examples
```typescript
// Always include:
// 1. Clear variable/function names
// 2. Comments explaining complex logic
// 3. Type annotations (this is TypeScript!)
// 4. Real-world scenarios

interface UserData {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// Good example: clear purpose, proper typing
function validateUserEmail(user: UserData): boolean {
  return user.email.includes('@');
}
```

### 3. Key Terms Formatting
```markdown
## í¿·ï¸ Key Terms

- **Term**: Short definition
- **Another Term**: Explanation highlighting what beginners should know
```

### 4. Real-World Scenario Format

### AI Engineering Example: [Scenario Name]

[Brief context about the problem]

\`\`\`typescript
// TypeScript code solving the problem
\`\`\`

### Frontend Example: [Scenario Name]

[Brief context]

\`\`\`typescript
// React/Web code example
\`\`\`
